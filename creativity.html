<p>üé®‚ú®Debugging Self-Doubt: Overcoming Imposter Syndrome in Tech and Life </p>
     <br>
  <p>Okay, time to get real...deep. If your anything like me 
    you have doubted yourself, like...ALOT. This allowed "Mr. <strong>Imposter Syndrome"</strong> or how I like to 
    refer to him by his real name: self doubt to creep on in. Let's chat about how I
    overcome the imposter syndrome (because honestly he really is the imposter...that should be on a shirt.)
  </p>
<br>
  <p>Here's a quick over-view for any newbies and our vets of what this actually is, because yes , it is a real THING:
  </p>

  <p style="text-indent: 20px;"> 
    <strong>Imposter syndrome</strong> is the persistent feeling of doubt about your abilities and accomplishments,
     and a fear of being exposed as a ‚Äúfraud,‚Äù even when there is clear evidence of your competence and success.
  </p>
<br>
  <p>How I learned to cope:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Celebrate the small wins:
      <p>I learned that I don‚Äôt need to wait until I‚Äôve built a database, landed a job at Google, moved to a tech hub, and started earning six figures just to finally recognize that I am a programmer ‚Äî and a good one at that.

I‚Äôve come to appreciate the small wins. The daily victories. The 30 minutes I spent coding. The notes I took, even if I didn‚Äôt review them right away. The practice websites I built over the past three years. Contrary to what many believe, small steps truly do add up over time.

I realized I had to take pride in my progress ‚Äî however small ‚Äî and allow myself to feel happy about it. Those small accomplishments have built the foundation for the bigger milestones I knew I would eventually reach. I‚Äôve had to remind myself that I belong in this space, that I am capable, and that even my early projects ‚Äî no matter how simple, even if they were ‚Äújust‚Äù HTML and CSS ‚Äî still mattered. That was a meaningful start, and it laid the groundwork for everything that followed. To sum it up. I had to shift my Mindset.
      
Know this, your doing great right where you are. We have to learn how to meet ourselves where we are and celebrate that victory because you are farther than you were yesterday! Your well on your way! You are doing great!
</p>
